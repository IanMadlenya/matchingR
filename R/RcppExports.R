#' Compute the Gale-Shapley Algorithm
#'
#' This function computes the Gale-Shapley Algorithm with one-to-one matching 
#' when both sides of the market are of the same size and everybody gets 
#' matched.
#'
#' @param prefM is a matrix with the preference order of the proposing side of 
#' the market
#' @param uW is matrix with cardinal utilities of the courted side of the 
#' market
#' @return A list with the successful proposals and engagements. 
#' \code{proposals} is a vector whose nth element contains the id of the female 
#' that male n is matched to. 
#' \code{engagements} is a vector whose nth element contains the id of the male 
#' that female n is matched to.
